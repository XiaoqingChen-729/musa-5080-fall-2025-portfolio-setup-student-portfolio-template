## About Me
[-Hi, this is Xiaoqing Chen, or just call me Kelsey. My undergraduate major is Architecture, and now i'm a MUSA student at Upenn. I'm intereseted in Data Analytics more than City Planning & Architecture Design, so i think that's the main reason why i choose this project. Hope i can learn more about coding from this courese. Nervertheless, the professor of this course is so humorous which make learning becoming more interesting.]
